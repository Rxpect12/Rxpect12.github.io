    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent applicatio to join us at the University
        of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> of your PhD next year.
        I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections
    </p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
        however it would suit us better if you<br> could start at the beginning
        of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reasearch
        facility - as long as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of
        sicence and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
        and just<br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
        ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>by are as follows, in order of
        priority.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30C (86F) when the<br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 increasing to 3 x 10^4.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long
        you`d expect the<br>research to take,required staff and other resources, and anything
        else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em>study exotic
    tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Polynesian chiken dance<br>
            &emsp;A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
        would dance around<br>&emsp;in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</li>
        <li>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
            &emsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to
            practice this dance, which<br>&emsp;involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,
            and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>&emsp;tiny, very rapid movements. 
            One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>&emsp;modern styles
            such as Twerking.
        </li>
        <li>Arctic robot dance<br>
            &emsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
            believed to have<br>&emsp;discovered a neew dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
            movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>&emsp;of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
            however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>&emsp;because they were really cold.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
